# Business Intelligence Sales Dashboard ‚Äì Power BI Project

## üéØ What I Built
For my final BI project at the justIT Data Skills Bootcamp, I developed a comprehensive sales dashboard in Power BI. The dashboard analyzes performance by tracking key metrics like sales revenue, profit margin, and order quantity across different countries, product categories, and time periods.

## üí° Key Things I Learnt
- **End-to-End BI Workflow**: I practiced the full process: connecting to multiple CSV data sources, transforming data in Power Query, creating a data model, writing DAX measures, building visuals, and publishing a final report.
- **DAX for Calculations**: I learned to write DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create new measures, such as calculating the Profit Margin percentage, which wasn't available in the original data.
- **Data Modeling**: I structured the data to create relationships between different tables, allowing for a single, cohesive dashboard where all visuals interact with each other.
- **Interactive Visualization**: I built a user-friendly dashboard with slicers and cross-filtering enabled, allowing any user to easily drill down into the data to find insights.

## üîç Top Insights
| Insight | Evidence | Business Takeaway |
|---|---|---|
| The US is the primary sales driver | The data shows the United States accounts for the vast majority of sales revenue, particularly in the high-value 'Bikes' category. | The US is the most critical market. Strategic decisions, marketing spend, and supply chain logistics should be prioritized for this region. |
| Profitability recovered in late 2019 | The monthly trend chart shows the company was operating at a loss (negative profit margin) in mid-2019 but successfully turned profitable by the end of the year. | This indicates a successful strategic change or market shift. The business should analyze what caused this turnaround and replicate those conditions. |
| Clothing is a high-volume category | While 'Bikes' generate the most revenue, 'Clothing' is the category with the highest quantity of items sold. | This suggests an opportunity to increase the profitability of the clothing line through upselling, bundling with high-margin accessories, or optimizing prices. |

## üéì Part of My Bootcamp Journey

## ü§î If I Had More Time
- I would use Power BI's forecasting feature on the time-series chart to predict future sales and profit margins.
- I would create a detailed "drill-through" page, allowing a user to right-click on a product category and navigate to a new page with an in-depth analysis of just that category.
